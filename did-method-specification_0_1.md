## About
This [DID method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes) conforms to the requirements in the DID specification currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and DID method specifications, please see the [DID Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md) and [DID Spec](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/).

The following DID Method will be registered in the [DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/).

## Abstract
Hedera Hashgraph is a multi-purpose open public ledger that uses hashgraph consensus - a fast, fair, and secure alternative to blockchains.

## Status of This Document
This document was published as an Editor's Draft.

Publication as an Editor's Draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than a work in progress.

## Motivation
This document defines a binding of the Decentralized Identifier architecture to Hedera Hashgraph - specifically how to use the Hedera File Service to record membership in 'business application networks' (appnets) and how to use the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for CRUD mechanisms on DID documents stored in such business application network. An business application network is a network of computers that store some set of business data (such as DID Documents) in a shared state, and rely on the Hedera mainnet for timestamping and ordering the transactions that cause that business application network state to change. An business application network could be exclusively dedicated to managing DID Documents and other identity artifacts in its state, or it could itself be multi-purpose. For instance, a Supply Chain could establish an business application network and, in addition to using HCS for tracking the location of shipments, use the DID method defined here to manage the identities of the associated companies, employees, and IoT devices. The HCS model is designed to off load from the Hedera mainnet node the burden of disk writes and long term storage and so allow those nodes to be optimized for high throughput ordering of transactions. 

## Hedera Hashgraph DID Method
The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: `hedera`

A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: `did:hedera`. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is the NSI specified below.

### Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)
The `did:hedera` namestring is defined by the following ABNF:
```abnf
hedera-did = "did:hedera:" hedera-specific-idstring ";" hedera-specific-parameters
hedera-specific-idstring = hedera-network ":" hedera-base58-key
hedera-specific-parameters = appnet-address-book [";" appnet-did-topic]
appnet-address-book = "hedera:" hedera-network ":fid=" appnet-address-book-file-id

appnet-did-topic = "hedera:" hedera-network ":tid=" appnet-did-topic-id
appnet-address-book-file-id = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
appnet-did-topic-id = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

hedera-network = "mainnet" / "testnet"
hedera-base58-key = 32*44(base58)
base58 = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" /
         "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" /
         "P" / "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" /
         "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" /
         "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" /
         "x" / "y" / "z"
```

Example:
```
did:hedera:mainnet:7Prd74ry1Uct87nZqL3ny7aR7Cg46JamVbJgk8azVgUm;hedera:mainnet:fid=0.0.123
```

The method specific identifier `hedera-specific-idstring` is composed of a Hedera network identifier with a `:` separator followed by a `hedera-base58-key` identifier which is a base58-encoded SHA-256 hash of a DID root public key and then method specific parameters `fid` and optionally `tid` (see details below). 

Hedera DIDs are not required to be registered on the ledger and may be used as unregistered pseudonymous pairwise identifiers. However, these identifiers may also be registered on the ledger within a specific appnet and be publicly resolvable or with access restriction defined by business application network owners. 

Every DID document registered on Hedera network MUST contain a public key of id `#did-root-key` and type `Ed25519VerificationKey2018`. The `hedera-base58-key` identifier is a base58-encoded SHA-256 hash of this public key.

Example Hedera DID document:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:hedera:mainnet:7Prd74ry1Uct87nZqL3ny7aR7Cg46JamVbJgk8azVgUm;hedera:mainnet:fid=0.0.123",

    }
  ],
  "service": [

      "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
      "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Method-Specific DID URL Parameters
There are two method-specific parameters defined for a Hedera DID:
- `fid` - a mandatory parameter that defines the FileID of a the corresponding business application network's address book file. The first step in resolving a DID is to retrieve the address book from the Hedera network, and so determine the addresses of the members of the business application network against which the second step of resolution can be performed. 
- `tid` - an optional parameter that defines a TopicID of Hedera Consensus Service topic to which a particular DID document was submitted. This can be used in case of open and publicly available DID documents to resolve DIDs without the use of appnet services.

A Hedera FileID is a triplet of numbers, e.g. `1.5.34634` represents file number `34634` within realm `5` within shard `1`.
Hedera TopicID follows a similar format and is defined as a triplet of numbers, e.g. `0.0.21243` represents a topic identifier `21243` within realm `0` within shard `0`.

Realms allow Solidity smart contracts to run in parallel. Realms are not relevant to this DID Method. In the future, when the number of consensus nodes warrants, the Hedera network will be divided up into shards such that a particular transaction will be processed into consensus only by a subset of the full set of nodes. 

##### Business Application Network Address Book
Each business application network that utilizes the Hedera DID Method must create and manage an address book file stored in the Hedera File Service. Unlike DID Documents which are persisted in an business application network's state, business application network address books are persisted in the state of the Hedera network nodes on the file service. The Hedera network consequently provides a decentralized and trusted discovery mechanism for business application network address books. The address book file contains URLs of the individual servers that comprise the business application network and that provide CRUD services for the DIDs within this business application network and Topic IDs within Hedera network used for posting DID and verifiable credentials. The address book is a JSON file compatible with a JSON schema defined [here](appnet-address-book.schema.json). 

Example address book file content:
```json
{
	"appnetName": "My Business Application Network",
	"didTopicId": "0.0.12345",
	"vcTopicId": "0.0.23456",
	"appnetDidServers": [
		"https://example.com/myappnet/hedera/api", 
		"https://example2.com/myappnet/api/v1", 
		"https://example3.com/myappnet"
	]
}
```
Specific authorizations for making change to the address book file for an business application network can be controlled via the list of keys associated with that file. Only transactions signed by the corresponding private keys will be authorized to update or delete the address book. Hedera supports hierarchical key structure to support a flexible authorization model.

## CRUD Operations
Hedera network nodes support a Consensus Service API by which clients submit transaction messages to a topic - these transactions assigned a consensus timestamp and order before flowing back out to mirror nodes and any business application network subscribed to the relevamt topic. Every business application network that implements the Hedera DID method must have a dedicated HCS topic created for DID documents registration. Members of the business application network will subscribe to the corresponding topics, and consesequently retrieve and store valid DID documents submitted to the topic. 

Create, Update and Delete operations against a DID Document are submitted via the Consensus Service API, either directly by a DID Owner or indirectly by an business application network member on behalf of a DID Owner

The two alternatives are:
![alt text](./images/create-update-delete.flow.svg "Create, Update and Delete flow alternatives")

The Read operation happens against either a mirror node or a member of the relevant appnet for the DID in question.

The two alternatives are:
![alt text](./images/read.flow.svg "Read flow alternatives")

A valid Create, Update, or Delete message must have a JSON structure defined by a [did-message-schema](did-message.schema.json) and contains the following properties:
- `mode` - Describes the mode in which the message content is provided. Valid values are: `plain` or `encrypted`. Messages in `encrypted` mode have `did` and `didDocumentBase64` attributes encrypted separately. Other attributes are plain.
- `message` - The message content with the following attributes:
  - `operation` - DID method operation to be performed on the DID document.  Valid values are: `create`, `update` and `delete`.
  - `did` -  - This field may contain either: 
    - a plain DID,
    - or a Base64-encoded encrypted representation of the DID, where the encryption and decryption methods and keys are defined by appnet owners.
  - `didDocumentBase64` - This field may contain either: 
    - a string that represents Base64-encoded DID document that conforms to the [DID Specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/),
    - or a Base64-encoded encrypted representation of Base64-encoded DID document, where the encryption and decryption methods and keys are defined by appnet owners.
  - `timestamp` - A message creation time. The value MUST be a valid XML datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of [W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/). This datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00, as indicated by the trailing "Z". It is important to note that this timestamp is a system timestamp as a variable part of the message and does not represent a consensus timestamp of a message submitted to the DID topic.
- `signature` - A Base64-encoded signature that is a result of signing a minified JSON string of a message attribute with a private key corresponding to the public key `#did-root-key` in the DID document.

Neither the Hedera network nor mirror nodes validate the DID Documents against the above requirements - it is business application network members that, as part of their subscription logic, must validate DID Documents based on the above criteria. The messages with duplicate signatures shall be disregarded and only the first one with verified signature is valid (in consensus timestamp order).

Here is an example of a complete message wrapped in an envelope and signed:
```json
{
  "mode": "plain",
  "message": {
    "operation": "create",
    "did": "did:hedera:mainnet:7Prd74ry1Uct87nZqL3ny7aR7Cg46JamVbJgk8azVgUm;hedera:mainnet:fid=0.0.123",
    "didDocumentBase64": "ewogICJAY29udGV...9tL3ZjLyIKICAgIH0KICBdCn0=",
    "timestamp": "2020-04-23T14:37:43.511Z"
  },
  "signature":  "QNB13Y7Q9...1tzjn4w=="
}
```

It is a responsibility of an business application network's administrators to decide who can submit messages to their DID topic. Access control of message submission is defined by a `submitKey` property of `ConsensusCreateTopicTransaction` body. If no `submitKey` is defined for a topic, then any party can submit messages against the topic. Detailed information on Hedera Consensus Service APIs can be found in the official [Hedera API documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera-api/consensus/consensusservice).

### Create
A DID document is created within a particular business application network by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction to a Hedera network node. It is executed by sending a `submitMessage` RPC call to the HCS API with the `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionBody` containing:
- `topicID` - equal to the ID of appnet's DID topic
- `message` - a JSON DID message envelope described above with `operation` set to `create`

Business application network members subscribed to this DID topic shall store the DID document in their local storage upon receiving this message from a mirror.

### Read
Read, or DID resolution, does not occur via HCS messages but rather directly against a computer that has persisted the DID Document.

How resolution of a DID into the corresponding DID Document occurs depends on whether the DID Document was submitted in encrypted or plaintext mode and, where resolution happens.

If submitted in plaintext mode, then resolution can occur either against a mirror node that may have persisted the history of messages for that DID Document, or against a member of the business application network that persisted the DID Document.

If resolved against a mirror, resolution requires reading the latest transaction message submitted to a DID topic for the given DID and checking if there was no earlier transaction for this DID with `operation` set to `delete` or another message with the same `signature`. This method can only be executed on a mirror node and may require reading a full history of messages in the topic. Hedera mirror nodes provide a [Hedera Consensus Service gRPC API](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/mirror-node-api/hedera-consensus-service-api-1). Client applications can use this API to subscribe to an appnet's DID topic to receive DID messages submitted to it and filter those that contain the DID to be resolved. 

Here is an example Java client, please refer to the official Hedera documentation for more information:
```java
new MirrorConsensusTopicQuery()
    .setTopicId(didTopicId)
    .subscribe(mirrorClient, resp -> {
          String didMessage = new String(resp.message, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
          System.out.println(resp.consensusTimestamp + " received DID message: " + didMessage);
      },
      // On gRPC error, print the stack trace
      Throwable::printStackTrace);
    });
```

If resolved against an business application network member, resolution requires calling business application network relay service (defined below). 

If the DID Document were submitted in encrypted mode, then resolution against a mirror is not possible unless the verifier is in possession of a decryption key and the business application network service is the only way of resolution.


### Update
A DID document is updated within the business application network by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction to a Hedera network node. It is executed by sending a `submitMessage` RPC call to HCS with the `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionBody` containing:
- `topicID` - equal to the ID of the appropriate appnet's DID topic
- `message` - a JSON DID message envelope described above with `operation` set to `update`

Business application network members subscribed to this DID topic shall replace the previous version of the DID document from their storage with this new version upon receiving this message from a mirror.


### Delete 
A DID document is deleted within the business application network by sending a `ConsensusSubmitMessage` transaction to a Hedera network node. It is executed by sending a `submitMessage` RPC call to HCS with the `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionBody` containing:
- `topicID` - equal to the ID of appnet's DID topic
- `message` - a JSON DID message envelope described above with `operation` set to `delete`

Business application network members subscribed to this DID topic shall delete the DID document from their storage or mark it as deleted upon receiving this message from a mirror.

### Appnet Relay Interface for CRUD Operations

DID Controllers, who have their own accounts on the Hedera network and are authorized to submit messages to an business application network's DID topic can send Create, Update, and Delete HCS transactions directly to a Hedera network node. Alternatively, DID Controllers can use an business application network's relay interface that will send the HCS messages for them. The access to an business application network's CRUD relay interface is defined by each business application network owner, so authentication and authorization mechanisms are out of scope. This specification only defines a common REST API interface for each CRUD operation. The interface path is relative to the service URLs defined in the business application network's address book file.

The mode in which the messages are submitted into the DID topic is defined by the business application network and in case of encryption, it is the business application network that controls encryption and decryption keys. Due to that, submission of create, update or delete messages is executed in two steps:
1. Message preparation
   - DID subject sends Create/Update/Delete request to the business application network with a DID document as request body
   - Business application network member prepares a message envelope taking care of encoding DID document, setting encryption mode and operation type
   - Business application network member responds with a message envelope without signature.
2. Message signing and submission
   - DID subject takes appnet's response envelope and signs the `message` content with their `#did-root-key`
   - DID subject sends Submit request to the appnet with the signed message envelope as request body.

All API operations shall have the same error response content as the following example:
```json
{
  "error" : {
    "code" : 404,
    "message" : "You are unauthorized to make this request."
  }
}
```

#### Create
Requests that a new DID document be created on the business application network network.

The DID Document is not considered to have been created until the DID Document was submitted to the HCS, received a consensus timestamp and order, been retrieved by the members of the appropriate appnet, and persisted in the business application network state.

The consensus timestamp assigned the Create message shall be interpreted as the time at which the DID Document was created, and used as the value of the 'created' property when the DID is subsequently resolved into the DID Document. 

The mode in which the DID document is submitted (plain or encrypted) is defined on the business application network level and shall be transparent to the API users.

#### Delete 
Requests that a given DID Document be deleted or revoked from the business application network network. The DID document submitted here should have at least `authentication` part empty, so that any subsequent DID ownership verification will fail.

The DID Document is not considered to have been deleted until the DID Document was submitted to the HCS, received a consensus timestamp and order, been retrieved by the members of the appropriate appnet, and persisted in the business application network state.

Depending on an business application network's storage implementation the DID document may be completely removed or instead only marked as deleted.

## Security Considerations

Security of Hedera DID Documents inherits the security properties of Hedera Hashgraph network itself and specific implementation of business application networks that persist the DID Documents.

Hedera Hashgraph uses the hashgraph algorithm for the consensus timestamping and ordering of transactions. Hashgraph is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) and fair, in that no particular node has the sole authority to decide the order of transactions, even if only for a short period of time. 

Hedera uses a proof of stake (POS) model to mitigate Sybil attacks. The influence of a particular node towards consensus is weighted by the amount of hbars, the network's native coin, they control.

Hedera charges fees for the processing of transactions into consensus and to partially mitigate Denial of Service attacks.

In the HCS model, messages are submitted to the Hedera network nodes, which collectively assign them a consensus timestamp and order within a topic, and then are deleted from those network consensus nodes. Consensus network nodes do not persist HCS messages beyond 3 minutes.

The messages are persisted only on mirror nodes, and appnet members that are subscribed to the corresponding topic.

Mirrors may persist HCS messages and are presumed to be public. Consequently, any data sent via HCS messages should be encrypted if sensitive. 

A public DID Document can be sent unencrypted. Public DIDs/DID Documents include public keys and service endpoints

If it be undesirable that a DID Document be public, it can be encrypted such that only members of an business application network can read it, or even specific members of the business application network. HCS supports perfect forward secrecy through key rotation to mitigate the risk of encrypted DID Documents persisted on mirrors being decrypted. 

Write access to Hedera Consensus Service DID Topics can be controlled by stipulating a list of public keys for the topic by business application network administrators. Only HCS messages signed by the corresponding private keys will be accepted. A key can be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements. 


## Privacy Considerations

Regardless of encryption, a DID Document should not include Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

The identifiers used to identify a subject create a greater risk of correlation when those identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one application domain as those domains could use that shared handle for the subject to share information about that subject without their express consent.

If DID Controllers want to mitigate the risk of correlation, they should use unique DIDs for every interaction and the corresponding DID Documents should contain a unique public key. 

The resolution process may leak PII as the resolver can infer that the Subject presenting the DID is interacting with the verifier resolving the DID. 

## Reference Implementations
The code at [https://github.com/hashgraph/did-sdk-java](https://github.com/hashgraph/did-sdk-java) is intended to provide a Java SDK for this DID method specification. A set of unit tests and example appnet application within this repository present a reference implementation of this DID method.
